# 05_-matplotlib-challenge: Pymaceuticals

* I reviewed my notes, PowerPoint slides, and the past PyCitySchools challenge to help guide me through the assignment.

* I looked up how to identify duplicate mice by Mouse ID and Timepoint, then reviewed the code to understand the methods used: duplicate_mice = complete_data_df[complete_data_df.duplicated(subset=["Mouse ID", "Timepoint"], keep=False)]["Mouse ID"].unique()

Summary Statistics 
* I refreshed my understanding of variance and standard deviation to better interpret these statistics. Standard deviation measures how far apart values are in a dataset and variance quantifies how much the values in the dataset vary from the mean. When the data points are close to the mean it suggests a high level of consistnacy within the data set. 

Bar and Pie Charts Section
* I asked the Xpert Learning Assistant and referenced activity materials heavily on this section to understand the differences between Pandas and Pyplot, as well as the methods for creating charts from a Series vs. a DataFrame. To illustrate my understanding, I practiced creating bar and pie charts from both a Series and a DataFrame.
